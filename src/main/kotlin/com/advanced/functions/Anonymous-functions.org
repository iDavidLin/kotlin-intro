#+TITLE: Anonymous Functions
* Anonymous Functions
** What is anonymous function?
Anonymous functions are like regular functions, but without a name.

** Anything special?
- Can declare the return type, while lambda can't.
- parameters are always passed inside the parentheses. If the last parameter of a function is an anonymous function, the anonymous function cannot go outside the parentheses (this works only for lambdas)!
- Unqualified return will return from the anonymous function itself.
